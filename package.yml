        # Important: require system addOns only! Find other addOns required in `package.setup.yml`.
        # This is because we want the demo to be installed in first place without the need to install
        # any other addOns beforehand. The demo comes with a setup feature which checks the
        # `package.setup.yml` file where all additional addOns are defined. It will download and
        # install these addOns seamlessly for you once youâ€™ve clicked the setup button.
        # After setup, both package files get merged. Be sure to not publish a merged `package.yml`
        # with your new release. Always use the original un-merged file!
